**What is the Background of Starbucks? What do they do?**

Starbucks Corporation is an American multinational chain of coffeehouses and roastery reserves headquartered in Seattle, Washington. As the world's largest coffeehouse chain, Starbucks is seen to be the main representation of the United States' second wave of coffee culture. As of early 2020, the company operates over 30,000 locations worldwide in more than 70 countries.

**Who are their competitors?**

The main competition and reason that Starbucks never truly took off in Australia is they did not manage to compete with the magnitude of smaller cafes and coffee houses that have been ingrained into Australian culture. 

Globally however, there are other conglomerates of similar size that such as McDonalds, Dunkin Donuts, Tullys, Lavazza and many more. 

Starbucks however has managed to hold a much higher percentage of market share when compared to these competitors however for coffee selling globally.

**How does this company use technology to their advantage? Why are they considered a FinTech company?**

Starbucks is piloting a blockchain technology in partnership with Microsoft, to keep track of the journey that its coffee beans make from farms to the coffee cup you drink each morning. Starbucks is by not means to be consifered a FinTech company, however, their goal of integrating FinTech services into advancing their supply chain logistics is a clear example of a firm adapting to modern times. 

Starbucks is working on a new feature for its mobile app that will show customers information about where what is the origin of their packaged coffee. Customers will be able to know using the app where the coffee beans they are enjoying were grown and what the company is doing to support farmers in those locations, also where and when it was roasted, tasting notes, and more.

Starbucks has long been committed to ethical sourcing for its coffee beans digital, real-time traceability using blockchain technology will allow customers to know more about how they are contributing by dinking their coffee cup, and coffee farmers will know where their beans go after they sell them.

**Why is this company exemplary in the FinTech space? What are their strengths and weaknesses?**

Their main strenght would be the 100% digital transperancy plan which would improve their brand image as it gives their consumers full transperancy as it  allows them to view the real time tracebility.The mobile app will show customers information about where their packaged coffee comes from, where it was grown and what Starbucks is doing to support farmers in those locations. It will also include where and when the coffee was roasted, associated  tasting notes and other details.

Also, Starbucks is embracing the digital disruption that is caused by emerging tecnologies. As, Starbucks is among a growing number of produce retailers to let customers trace their food's journey from farm to store shelf. For example, IBM's blockchain-based Food Trust blockchain network, launched in August 2017, is used by more than two dozen food retailers and suppliers, including Dole, Driscoll's, Golden State Foods, Kroger, McCormick and Company, Nestl√©, Tyson Foods, Unilever and Walmart.

**What is the prognosis for this company? Where do they expect to be in the future?**

In the near future, we are able to expect predictive drive through ordering with the use of internet of things which is connected to their coffee machine which will further boost their bean to cup tracking. Also, These IoT-enabled machines could then collect more than a dozen data points for every shot of coffee pulled, including the type of beans, the temperature of a cup of coffee and water quality.

Moreover, they are also looking at predictive drive-thru ordering where the app, which already makes suggestions based on previous orders, would extend to digital billboards. This could well be the foundation for facial recognition and targeted recommendations, but that is not being talked about just yet.
