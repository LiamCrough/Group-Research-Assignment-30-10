**What is the Background of Starbucks? What do they do?**

Starbucks Corporation is an American multinational chain of coffeehouses and roastery reserves headquartered in Seattle, Washington. As the world's largest coffeehouse chain, Starbucks is seen to be the main representation of the United States' second wave of coffee culture. As of early 2020, the company operates over 30,000 locations worldwide in more than 70 countries.

**Who are their competitors?**

The main competition and reason that Starbucks never truly took off in Australia is they did not manage to compete with the magnitude of smaller cafes and coffee houses that have been ingrained into Australian culture. 

Globally however, there are other conglomerates of similar size that such as McDonalds, Dunkin Donuts, Tullys, Lavazza and many more. 

Starbucks however has managed to hold a much higher percentage of market share when compared to these competitors however for coffee selling globally.

**How does this company use technology to their advantage? Why are they considered a FinTech company?**

Starbucks is piloting a blockchain technology in partnership with Microsoft, to keep track of the journey that its coffee beans make from farms to the coffee cup you drink each morning. Starbucks is by not means to be consifered a FinTech company, however, their goal of integrating FinTech services into advancing their supply chain logistics is a clear example of a firm adapting to modern times. 

Starbucks is working on a new feature for its mobile app that will show customers information about where what is the origin of their packaged coffee. Customers will be able to know using the app where the coffee beans they are enjoying were grown and what the company is doing to support farmers in those locations, also where and when it was roasted, tasting notes, and more.

Starbucks has long been committed to ethical sourcing for its coffee beans digital, real-time traceability using blockchain technology will allow customers to know more about how they are contributing by dinking their coffee cup, and coffee farmers will know where their beans go after they sell them.

**What is the prognosis for this company? Where do they expect to be in the future?**

In the near future, we are able to expect predictive drive through ordering with the use of internet of things which is connected to their coffee machine which will further boost their bean to cup tracking.
